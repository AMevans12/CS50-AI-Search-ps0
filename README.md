## Introduction

This repository contains implementations for two projects from the CS50 AI course's Problem Set 0. These projects demonstrate the application of artificial intelligence techniques in solving real-world problems.

## Projects

### Degrees of Separation

The Degrees of Separation project involves finding the shortest path between two actors via their co-stars. This is achieved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph of actors and movies.

#### Key Features

- Utilizes BFS to find the shortest connection between actors.
- Demonstrates practical graph traversal techniques.
- Calculates "degrees of separation" between actors.

#### Usage

To run the Degrees of Separation project:

```bash
python degrees.py CS50-AI-ps0
```

Replace `CS50-AI-ps0` with the path to the directory containing your data files.

### AI Tic-Tac-Toe

The AI Tic-Tac-Toe project features a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the computer plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm. The AI ensures it never loses, providing a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.

#### Key Features

- Implements the Minimax algorithm for optimal play.
- Ensures the AI never loses.
- Demonstrates AI decision-making processes.

#### Usage

To run the AI Tic-Tac-Toe game:

```bash
python tictactoe.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game against the AI.
